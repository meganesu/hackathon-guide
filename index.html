      <h1>Hackathon Planning Guide</h1>
      <h2>What is a Hackathon?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>hackathon</strong> is an event where people get together and utilize their skills in coding to build something that can solve a problem with a set deadline. These deadlines can last anywhere from 1 day to a week.</p>

        <p>Upon first arriving at a hackathon several project ideas are pitched to students. Everyone eventually divides into groups to work on the pitched projects that interest them and then begin furiously coding to build a working prototype for their project. These working prototypes can be apps, websites, or even a hardware hack.</p>

        <p>Hackathons can provide a fun way for students to collaborate on a project. Here we've provided guidelines for you to be able to host your own hackathon. Our current guidelines are designed for a day long hackathon that we imagine occuring on a weekend.</p>

        <p>Here we've detailed all the necessary steps you will need to take in order to plan for your hackathon.</p>
      <h2>Planning Your Hackathon</h2>
      <h3>3 Months Before Hackathon:</h3>
        <details>
          <summary>Locate a venue, finalize a date and time</summary>
          <div class="expanded">
            <p>Find a location for your event, and book a date and time. Try contacting your school, your local library, your neighborhood community center.</p>

            <p>Make sure to ask about the maximum number of attendees you can have. This will inform your registration limit for your hackathon.</p>

            <p>Be on the lookout for venues with:<p>
            <ul>
              <li>Technical equipment</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Is there wifi? Is it free? Is it fast enough to accommodate all your attendees?</li>
                  <li>Are there enough power outlets for everyone attending? Do you need to bring additional power strips and extension cords?</li>
                  <li>Is there AV (audio visual) equipment? Is there a microphone or PA system you can use to talk to the entire group at once? Is there a projector you and teams can use to present?</li>
                </ul>
              <li>A variety of workspaces (a large room where you can present to all attendees at once, smaller breakout spaces where individual teams can work on their projects)</li>
